# RYT_MBP1413_PBMC68k_Project
 Code for the PBMC68k project for MBP1413

The R_script_preprocessing directory contains modified code from the GitHub repository used to generate figures found in the original publication (https://github.com/10XGenomics/single-cell-3prime-paper/tree/master/pbmc68k_analysis). These code are modified to extract the raw RNA-seq data and other relevant information of the pure and PBMC68k population.

The python_script_machine_learning directory contains jupyter notebooks with code used to generate and train the MLP and VAE models for the cell-type classification task. Code used to generate all figures in the report is also included in these notebooks.
